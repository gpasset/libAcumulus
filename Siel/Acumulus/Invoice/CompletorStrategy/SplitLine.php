/**
 * Class SplitLine implements a vat completor strategy by recognizing that a
 * (discount) line can have any vat rate between the minimum and maximum vat
 * rate. This because the discount can be divided over multiple products that
 * have different vat rates.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 * - lines2Complete contains at least 1 line that may be split.
 * - Exactly 2 vat rates that appear in the invoice, otherwise we can't compute
 *   1 division.
 * - This strategy should be executed after the tryAllVatRatePermutations, so we
 *   may assume that we *have to* split to arrive at a solution.
 *
 * Strategy:
 * Other non completed lines, typically shipping and other fees, are all given
 * the same vat rate and subsequently the then remaining vat to divide is split
 * ove the slit lines.
 *
 * If there are multiple split lines, we cannot arrive at a correct division
 * for all theses line separately, so we combine them into 1 discount line and
 * split that line in 2.
 *
 * As this strategy has a lot of freedom it will probably succeed with the first
 * try. Therefore we should start with the "most correct" vat rate for the fee
 * lines, being the key component (hoofdbestanddeel). But as no known shop
 * implements this, we start with the maximum rate (this is used by most shops)
 * followed by the minimum rate but only if it is the key component.
 *
 * Possible improvements:
 * - Instead of restricting us to vat rates that already appear on the invoice,
 *   we could also look at the possible vat rates that are part of the vat type
 *   for the invoice (given that the vat type has 2 vat rates).
 *   Example: all low vat products, but high vat shipping (because that is set
 *   as such, even if it would not be necessary in this case) and a discount
 *   over the whole order amount, thus products + shipping, and both the
 *   shipping and discount line are strategy lines, where the discount line is
 *   the split line.
 * - Instead of restricting us to 1 vat type, we could check for all still
 *   possible vat types that have only 2 vat rates.
 * - Instead of restricting us to appearing or possible vat rates we could try
 *   to assume that 1 line is a prepaid voucher and therefore vat free, and
 *   split just the other line(s).
 *
 * Current known usages:
 * - ???
